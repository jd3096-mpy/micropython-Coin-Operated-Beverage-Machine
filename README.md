## Project Overview

This is a coin-operated beverage machine project that combines fun and practicality, with the **M5Stack DinMeter** as the core controller. It enables precise control of the water output through the DinMeter knob. The system integrates a coin acceptor, water pump, toggle switch, relay, and other components, all housed in a custom-made black metal case with a strong industrial aesthetic.

The operation is straightforward: insert a coin → rotate the DinMeter to adjust the flow → press the switch to dispense the drink. Every interaction brings a sense of fun, making it not only a functional beverage dispenser but also an eye-catching “atmosphere device.”

It’s suitable for bars, parties, exhibitions, maker spaces, and other venues—adding a unique touch of technology and creativity to the environment. This project is more than just a device; it’s a playful fusion of people, technology, and imagination.
